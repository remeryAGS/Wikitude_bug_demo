Wikitude_bug_demo
=================

Demonstration of a bug I encountered in Wikitude. After interacting with a button in the AR view,
the Android keyboard will not launch.

# To Encounter Bug
1. Type in the text box
2. Click button to launch AR view
3. Click the button at the top of the screen a few times
4. Press back, return to main view
5. Type in the text box

After repeating these steps two or three times, the Android keyboard will no longer launch.
This seems to be timing based. If I perform the steps very quickly I can sometimes get through
four or five times before the keyboard brakes. If I perform them slowly I can only get through
one or two.
